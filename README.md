# Jira integration pack

This pack consists of a sample Jira sensor and a Jira action.

## Installation

You will need to have `gcc` installed on your system.
For Ubuntu systems, run `sudo apt-get install gcc`.
For Redhat/CentOS systems, run `sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel`.
To build the python cryptography dependency (part of the following `st2 pack install` command) 2GB of RAM is recommended.
In some cases adding a swap file may eliminate strange gcc compiler errors.

Then install this pack with: `st2 pack install jira`

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [jira.yaml.example](./jira.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/jira.yaml` and edit as required.

* ``url`` - URL of the Jira instance (e.g. ``https://myproject.atlassian.net``)
* ``poll_interval`` - Polling interval - default 30s
* ``project`` - Key of the project which will be used as a default with some of the actions which
  don't require or allow you to specify a project (e.g. ``STORM``).
* ``verify`` - Verify SSL certificates. Default True. Set to False to disable verification
* ``auth_method`` - Specify either `basic`, `oauth`, `api_token` or `PAT` authentication

Include the following settings when using the `oauth` auth_method:

* ``rsa_cert_file`` - Path to the file with a private key
* ``oauth_token`` - OAuth token
* ``oauth_secret`` - OAuth secret
* ``consumer_key`` - Consumer key

Include the following settings when using the `basic` auth_method:

* ``username`` - Username
* ``password`` - Password

Include the following settings when using the `PAT` auth_method:

* ``token`` - PAT token

Include the following settings when using the `api_token` auth_method:

* ``token`` - api token
* ``username`` - Username

If using the `oauth` auth_method, take a look at the OAuth section below for further setup instructions.

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the
[docs](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/pack_configs.html) for more info.

**Note** : When modifying the configuration in `/opt/stackstorm/configs/` please
           remember to tell StackStorm to load these new values by running
           `st2ctl reload --register-configs`

### OAuth

### Disclaimer

This documentation is written as of 06/17/2014.
Jira 6.3 implements OAuth1.
Most of this document would need to be revised when Jira switches to OAuth2.

### Steps

1. Generate RSA public/private key pair

```shell
$ openssl genrsa -out stackstorm-jira.pem 4096
```

2. Create the public key associated with that private key

```shell
$ openssl rsa -in stackstorm-jira.pem -pubout
```

3. Generate a consumer key. You can use python uuid.uuid4() to do this, for example:

```shell
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 30 2016, 19:40:32)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.34)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import uuid
>>> print uuid.uuid4()
210660f1-ca8a-40d5-a6ee-295ccbf3074d
>>>
```

4. Configure Jira for external access:

    * Go to AppLinks section of your Jira at `https://{jira_server}/plugins/servlet/applinks/listApplicationLinks`
    * Create a Generic Application with some fake URL
    * Click Edit, choose IncomingAuthentication, plug in the consumer key and RSA public key you generated.

5. Get access token using this [script](https://github.com/lakshmi-kannan/jira-oauth-access-token-generator/blob/master/generate_access_token.py).
   You may need to install additional libraries to run that script, and you will need to edit the script to use your file locations.
   Check the [README](https://github.com/lakshmi-kannan/jira-oauth-access-token-generator/blob/master/README.md) file for more information.
   The access token is printed at the end of running that script.
   Save these keys somewhere safe.

6. Plug in the access token and access secret into the sensor or action.
   You are good to make Jira calls.
   Note: OAuth token expires.
   You'll have to repeat the process based on the expiry date.

## Sensors

* ``JiraSensor`` - Sensor which monitors JIRA for new tickets.
* ``JiraSensorForAPIv2`` - Sensor which monitors JIRA for new tickets.

The sensor monitors for new tickets and sends a trigger into the system whenever there is a new ticket.

## Actions

* ``add_field_value`` - Add a field to a particular JIRA issue.
* ``assign_issue`` - Assigning an issue to a user.
* ``attach_file_to_issue`` - Attach a file to JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``attach_files_to_issue`` - Attach multiple files to JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``bulk_link_issue`` - Link many JIRA issues to another JIRA issue.
* ``comment_issue`` - Comment on a JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``create_issue`` - Create a new JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``get_issue`` - Retrieve information about a particular JIRA issue.
* ``get_issue_attachments`` - Retrieve attachments for a particular JIRA issue.
* ``get_issue_comments`` - Retrieve comments for a particular JIRA issue.
* ``get_issue_links`` - Retrieve linked issues for a particular JIRA issue.
* ``link_issue`` - Link one JIRA issue to another JIRA issue.
* ``search_issues`` - Search JIRA issues with a JQL query.
* ``transition_issue`` - Do a transition on a JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``transition_issue_by_name`` - Do a transition on a JIRA issue / ticket.
* ``update_field_value`` - Update a field in a particular JIRA issue.
